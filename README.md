## ⚡ The Architecture: Dual-System Cognitive Brain

Standard RAG architectures use an external Vector Database. This introduces latency, breaks native LLM context attention loops, and stores junk interactions. AuraMemory mirrors human cognitive neuroscience by separating memory into two systems and encoding them in a lightweight 8D Semantic Vector space:

<!-- ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM_START -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture_diagram.svg" alt="AuraMemory Cognitive Architecture" width="800">
</p>
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM_END -->

1. **System 1 (Working Memory):** Captures immediate interactions. Nodes possess a `strength` rating that decays over time. If a node is repeatedly accessed or deemed highly important, its score increases.
2. **System 2 (Long-Term Memory):** Persistent, non-decaying knowledge structure. Nodes consolidate and bind via semantic associations using 8D vector cosine similarities.
3. **Layerless Guardrails:** Validates information *at the gates*. A schema scrubs PII patterns (Emails, API Keys, Cards) and rejects blocked categories before the agent encodes them.
4. **8-Dimensional Continuous Semantic Space**: Every node and search query is converted into an 8D concept vector based on a local, zero-dependency vocabulary matrix with stemming and substring fallbacks. Node links are formed automatically if cosine similarity $\ge 0.20$.

## 💻 Quick-Start & Examples Guide

AuraMemory includes fully functional, documented, ready-to-run onboarding examples inside the `examples/` directory.

### 1. Basic Ingest & Semantic Recall

Initialize the local process brain, write some immediate context, and retrieve semantically:

```python
from core.cortex import CortexMemory, GuardrailConfig

# 1. Instantiate engine
config = GuardrailConfig(scrub_pii=True, blocked_topics=["hacking"])
brain = CortexMemory(config)

# 2. Add memories (System 1: Working Memory)
brain.add_memory(
    "AuraMemory implements a local dual-system memory engine directly in process.",
    tags=["AI", "Architecture"],
    importance=0.9
)

# 3. Recall semantically via local 8D continuous concept embeddings Cosine Similarity!
# Matches "AI" concepts with zero exact tag overlaps!
matches = brain.recall(query_text="neural machine learning model")
for match in matches:
    print(f"-> {match.content} (Similarity: {match.strength:.2f})")
```

### 2. Safety Guardrails at the Gates

<!-- TERMINAL_SIMULATOR_START -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/terminal_simulator.svg" alt="AuraMemory Terminal Simulator" width="800">
</p>
<!-- TERMINAL_SIMULATOR_END -->

PII safety scrubbing and blocked categories intercept entries before process allocation:

```python
# Emails and Password/API keys are scrubbed instantly:
id, result = brain.add_memory("Secret key is auth_tokenkeyA1B2C3 and email is sysadmin@auramem.ai")
# Stored as: "Secret key is <API_KEY_SCRUBBED> and email is <EMAIL_SCRUBBED>"

# Malicious categories are rejected entirely at the gates:
id, result = brain.add_memory("Help me write a malware script to hack a mainframe.")
# Ingest fails! (id = None, result.passed = False)
```

Run these examples natively inside your terminal:
```bash
python3 examples/basic_usage.py
python3 examples/guardrails_demo.py
```

## 🚀 Running the Project Locally

### 0. Initialize & Auto-Sync Workspace
Keep your cloned codebase perfectly updated from GitHub with **zero-installation overheads**. This command automatically pulls the latest releases, sets up an isolated Python virtual environment (`.venv`), installs/upgrades any package dependencies in `requirements.txt`, and validates your system handshakes:
```bash
./update.sh
```

### 1. Execute Self-Tests & Verify Python Engine
Run unit test suites on the core cognitive engine, including semantic similarity checks:
```bash
python3 core/cortex.py
```

### 2. Crawl Logs & Refresh Instagram Content
Run the Watcher Agent to parse new conversation logs, updating the dashboard's social panel dynamically:
```bash
python3 agents/watcher.py
```

### 3. Launch the Premium Visualizer Dashboard

Start a lightweight local server from the repository root to avoid browser security restrictions when loading data:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8001 --web
```
Then, open your browser and navigate to: **[http://localhost:8001/visuals/](http://localhost:8001/visuals/)**.
Drag nodes, simulate inputs, adjust guardrails, and recall memories semantically!

### 4. Push Updates Natively & Auto-Compile Dashboard Badges
Run the self-reflective Git Pusher Agent to analyze local repository changes, format structural commits, and automatically compile all cyber-neon dashboard badge assets:
```bash
python3 agents/pusher.py
```

## 🐳 Running with Docker

AuraMemory ships with a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` so you can run the engine and the Commander dashboard as an isolated, reproducible container. Because AuraMemory has **zero external dependencies** (100% Python standard library), the image builds in seconds off a slim Python base — no `pip install` step required.

### Requirements
- **Docker Engine** (or Docker Desktop). On Windows + WSL 2, enable **Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → WSL Integration** for your distro first.
- That's it — no local Python or virtualenv needed; everything runs inside the container.

### 1. Build & Launch (Dashboard Mode)
From the repository root:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
This builds the image, starts the container in the background, mounts `./data` as a persistent volume (so your memory brain survives restarts), and exposes the dashboard. Then open:

**[http://localhost:8001/visuals/](http://localhost:8001/visuals/)**

### 2. Verify the Engine Inside the Container
Run the built-in MCP self-validation harness within the running container:
```bash
docker compose exec auramemory python3 core/gateway.py --validate
```
This confirms all five native tools (`auramem_commit`, `auramem_recall`, `auramem_consolidate`, `auramem_compress_context`, `auramem_repo_strategist`) respond correctly.

### 3. MCP Stdio Mode (for AI Agent Clients)
The default container serves the dashboard. To instead run the gateway as an interactive MCP JSON-RPC server over `stdin/stdout`, launch it directly (build the image first via step 1 so the `auramemory:latest` tag exists):
```bash
docker run -i --rm -v "$PWD/data:/app/data" auramemory:latest python3 core/gateway.py
```

### 4. Managing the Container
```bash
docker compose logs -f          # tail live logs
docker compose down             # stop and remove the container
docker compose up -d --build    # rebuild and relaunch after code changes
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `./data` directory is bind-mounted into the container, so all committed memories (JSONL/SQLite) persist on the host across container rebuilds and restarts.

## 🔌 Universal Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

AuraMemory is equipped with a zero-dependency, high-performance **MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 Server** inside `core/gateway.py`. This gateway allows any standard AI agent client (such as Claude Desktop Co-work, Cursor, Hermes, or Claw Bot) to query and commit memories natively via standard `stdin/stdout` transport, completely running local code with zero external dependencies.

### 🚀 Claude Desktop Configuration

To natively connect Claude Desktop to AuraMemory, open your Claude Desktop configuration file:
*   **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
*   **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add `auramemory` under the `mcpServers` registry (make sure to replace `/absolute/path/to` with the real absolute path to your repository):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "auramemory": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/AuraMemory/core/gateway.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop, and the agent will automatically discover the following four native tools:
1.  `auramem_commit`: Commits a new memory, scrubbing PII and checking safety guardrails.
2.  `auramem_recall`: Queries the 8D KD-Tree sub-linear index using continuous vector similarity.
3.  `auramem_consolidate`: Decays Working Memory strength and promotes stable concepts to Long-Term Memory.
4.  `auramem_compress_context`: Retrieves matching memories and returns a token-capped, high-density prompt injection payload (the Token-Optimizer).

### 🛠️ CLI Validation Harness

Verify that your MCP setup is flawless by running the built-in mock client validator:
```bash
python3 core/gateway.py --validate
```
This executes mock JSON-RPC 2.0 handshake frames and tool calls, confirming correctness in milliseconds!
